# Data Engineering Zoomcamp – Core Rules

## Project mindset

- Treat this repo as a learning and experimentation space.
- Prefer clear, straightforward solutions over clever or heavily abstracted ones.
- Align solutions with common data engineering practices (as taught in the course) rather than exotic patterns.

## AI usage & tool FOMO

- Work **within this repo and its existing tech stack** unless explicitly asked to introduce new tools or frameworks.
- Do **not** recommend large new platforms, agent frameworks, or extra AI tools by default; only mention them when directly relevant to a concrete problem.
- When comparing tools or models, keep the focus on **practical impact for this project**, not hype or benchmarks.
- Prefer incremental improvements using the current setup over wholesale rewrites or big new architectures.

## Learning-first AI usage

- By default, attempt a task yourself (even if imperfect) before asking the AI to solve it.
- Prefer requests for **hints, feedback, or explanations** over asking for full solutions.
- When the AI proposes code, also ask it to **explain key decisions and trade-offs** in simple language.
- Encourage comparisons: when relevant, ask the AI to contrast your solution with an alternative and highlight what you can learn from the differences.

## Coding style – Python & SQL

- Optimize for **readability and pedagogy**: write code that a learner following the Zoomcamp can understand.
- Keep functions focused and small; avoid unnecessary indirection or meta-programming.
- Use standard libraries and commonly used data-engineering libraries where possible; avoid introducing niche dependencies unless clearly justified.
- For SQL:
  - Use clear, descriptive names for tables, CTEs, and columns.
  - Prefer step-by-step transformations (e.g., CTEs) over deeply nested queries when it aids understanding.

## Changes to project structure

- Respect the existing module layout from the Zoomcamp; avoid heavy restructuring unless the user explicitly requests it.
- When adding scripts or notebooks, name them descriptively and keep them close to the relevant module (e.g., `Module_5` work under `Module_5/`).

## Explanations and documentation

- When implementing non-trivial logic, include brief, high-signal explanations in either docstrings, markdown, or comments focused on *why*, not obvious *what*.
- When suggesting commands (e.g., to run a pipeline or tests), provide them in a copy-pastable form.
